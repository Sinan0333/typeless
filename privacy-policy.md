# Privacy Policy for TypeLess

TypeLess is a Chrome extension designed to help users fill web forms using their own saved data.

## Data Collection
TypeLess does not collect, track, or transmit personal data to any external servers.

## Data Storage
All user data is stored locally in the user’s browser using Chrome’s storage APIs. This data never leaves the user’s device unless the user explicitly enables optional features in the future.

## Permissions
TypeLess only requests permissions required for its core functionality, such as accessing the active tab, storing user data locally, and filling form fields when triggered by the user.

## Third-Party Services
TypeLess does not use third-party services to collect or process user data.

## Changes
This privacy policy may be updated as features evolve. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
